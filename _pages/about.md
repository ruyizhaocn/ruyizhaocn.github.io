Welcome to My Academic Website!
======
Hello! I’m Ruyi Zhao, a dedicated researcher with a passion for ultrafast optics, biomedical imaging, and optical engineering. This website serves as a platform to share my research journey, achievements, and academic contributions.

## Education
**Master of International Bioengineering**, The University of Tokyo (UTokyo), Japan  
*Sep. 2023 – expected Jul. 2025*  
- Core modules: Bioimaging, Advanced Biodevices, Advanced Biomaterials
- Research areas: Cell-shockwave interaction, Ultrafast imaging, Imaging flow cytometry  

**Bachelor of Opto-Electronics Information Science and Engineering**, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), China  
*Sep. 2019 – Jul. 2023*  
- GPA: 3.7/4; Graduation project rated as ‘Excellent’
- Research areas: Hyperspectral compressive imaging, Deep learning  

## Research Experience
**Postgraduate Project: Imaging Flow Cytometry for Ultrafast Acoustic Cellular Interaction**  
*UTokyo, Sep. 2023 – Present*  
- Proposed DIC-STAMP (Differential Interference Contrast-STAMP) to enhance shockwave edge detection for detailed wavefront analysis.
- Developed a TSMD module for STAMP to enable independent control of pulse trains (intervals: 0.1ns to 3ns), improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
- Integrated STAMP with Nikon Ti2-U microscope, enabling co-axial laser-induced shockwave generation.

**Undergraduate Project: Deep Learning-based Spectral Compressive Imaging**  
*BIT, Sep. 2022 – Jun. 2023*  
- Implemented a Transformer-based hyperspectral reconstruction algorithm to improve CASSI hyperspectral imaging.
- Achieved an average SSIM of 92% and PSNR of 34.22 dB on the KAIST dataset.

**Mitacs Globalink Research Internship: Compressed Optical-Streaking Ultra-high-speed Photography**  
*INRS, Montreal, Aug. 2022 – Nov. 2022*  
- Constructed a compact COSUP system for RGB, low-light, and miniaturized ultrafast imaging.

## Other Experience
**Bioengineering Summer Experiment**  
*UTokyo, Sep. 2024 – Nov. 2024*  
- Synthesized and PEG-modified MEH-PPV fluorescent polymer dots (Pdots) for cellular fluorescence imaging.

**Engineering Summer Education Program (ESEP-G) Research Mentor**  
*UTokyo, Jun. 2024 – Aug. 2024*  
- Mentored an Oxford undergraduate student on STAMP system principles and optical experiment techniques.

**Olympic Broadcasting Services Training Programme**  
*Beijing Winter Olympics, Jan. 2022 – Feb. 2022*  
- Served as a venue production assistant, coordinating with international photojournalists and translating for staff.

## Selected Awards and Honors
